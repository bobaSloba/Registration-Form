# Registration-Form
The Registration Form project from freeCodeCamp
In this project i built a registration form with HTML and CSS. I learned how a form works , how to add all different kinds of inputs and manipulate them. And in the end how to style them. This was a very fun project and kind of my first real one. The journey never ends , cant wait to build my next project!
